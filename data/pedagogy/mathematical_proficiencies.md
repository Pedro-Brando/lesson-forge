# Mathematical Proficiencies in the Australian Curriculum v9

## Overview
The Australian Curriculum: Mathematics v9 embeds four mathematical proficiencies across all content strands and year levels. These proficiencies describe the actions in which students engage when learning and using mathematical content.

## The Four Proficiencies

### Understanding
Students build robust knowledge of adaptable and transferable mathematical concepts. They:
- Make connections between related concepts and representations
- Describe their thinking mathematically
- Interpret mathematical information
- Represent concepts in different ways (concrete, visual, symbolic)

**In practice**: A student who understands fractions can explain that 3/4 means 3 out of 4 equal parts, show it on a number line, shade a diagram, and connect it to division.

### Fluency
Students develop skills in choosing appropriate procedures, carrying them out flexibly, and recalling factual knowledge efficiently. They:
- Calculate answers efficiently
- Recognise robust ways of answering questions
- Choose appropriate methods and approximations
- Recall definitions and regularly used facts

**In practice**: A student fluent in multiplication can quickly recall that 7 × 8 = 56, choose to use the distributive property for 7 × 12, and estimate 7 × 98 ≈ 700.

### Problem-Solving
Students develop the ability to make choices, interpret, formulate, model, investigate, and communicate. They:
- Apply existing strategies to new situations
- Plan approaches and verify solutions
- Communicate their problem-solving processes
- Use mathematical modelling in real-world contexts

**In practice**: A student solving a problem about fencing a garden can identify the relevant mathematics (perimeter), choose an appropriate strategy, carry it out, and check if the answer is reasonable.

### Reasoning
Students develop an increasingly sophisticated capacity for logical thought and actions. They:
- Analyse, prove, evaluate, explain, infer, and generalise
- Use mathematical structure and relationships
- Form and test conjectures
- Construct logical arguments

**In practice**: A student reasoning about odd and even numbers can explain why the sum of two odd numbers is always even, using either examples, diagrams, or algebraic notation appropriate to their year level.

## Proficiencies Across Year Levels

### Foundation to Year 2
- Understanding: Connecting names, numerals, and quantities
- Fluency: Counting sequences, simple addition facts
- Problem-solving: Modelling with materials, drawing pictures
- Reasoning: Explaining choices, comparing quantities

### Years 3-6
- Understanding: Connecting fraction concepts across representations
- Fluency: Recall of multiplication facts, efficient algorithms
- Problem-solving: Multi-step problems, mathematical modelling
- Reasoning: Justifying methods, identifying patterns and generalisations

### Years 7-10
- Understanding: Abstract concepts, algebraic relationships
- Fluency: Operating with rational numbers, algebraic manipulation
- Problem-solving: Formulating equations, statistical investigation
- Reasoning: Mathematical proof, deductive reasoning, generalisation

## Integration with Teaching Approaches
- **Explicit Instruction**: Builds fluency and foundational understanding
- **Inquiry-Based Learning**: Develops problem-solving and reasoning
- **Practice Activities**: Consolidates fluency through repetition
- **Assessment Tasks**: Should assess all four proficiencies, not just fluency
