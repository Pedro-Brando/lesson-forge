# Inquiry-Based Learning and Deep Learning in Mathematics

## Overview
Inquiry-based learning in mathematics involves students exploring mathematical concepts through investigation, problem-solving, and reasoning rather than direct instruction alone. It develops deep understanding, mathematical thinking, and the proficiencies outlined in the Australian Curriculum.

## Mathematical Proficiencies (ACARA v9)
The Australian Curriculum identifies four proficiency strands that inquiry naturally develops:
- **Understanding**: connecting ideas, representing concepts in multiple ways
- **Fluency**: carrying out procedures flexibly, accurately, and efficiently
- **Problem-solving**: making choices, interpreting, formulating, modelling
- **Reasoning**: explaining thinking, justifying strategies, proving results

## Thinking Routines for Mathematics
### See-Think-Wonder
- Present a mathematical pattern or image
- Students describe what they see, think about its meaning, and wonder about extensions

### Claim-Support-Question
- Students make a mathematical claim
- Provide evidence or proof to support it
- Others ask clarifying or challenging questions

### What Makes You Say That?
- Requires students to justify their mathematical reasoning
- Builds a culture of evidence-based argumentation

## Problem-Solving Strategies
1. **Understand the problem**: Read, identify knowns and unknowns
2. **Devise a plan**: Choose a strategy (draw a diagram, make a table, work backwards, simplify)
3. **Carry out the plan**: Execute systematically, show working
4. **Look back**: Check reasonableness, consider alternative methods, extend the problem

## Non-Routine Problems
Non-routine problems have no immediately obvious strategy. They require:
- Persistence and productive struggle
- Multiple attempts and approaches
- Collaboration and discussion
- Reflection on the process, not just the answer

## Socratic Questioning in Mathematics
- What do you notice about this pattern?
- Can you explain why that works?
- Will this always be true? How do you know?
- Can you find a counter-example?
- How is this connected to what we learned about...?
