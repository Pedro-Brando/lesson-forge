# Differentiation in Mathematics Education

## Principles of Differentiation
Differentiation in mathematics means providing multiple pathways for students to engage with the same mathematical concept at an appropriate level of challenge. It is not about giving different content, but about providing appropriate entry points and extending thinking.

## The Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)
Vygotsky's ZPD describes the space between what a learner can do independently and what they can achieve with guidance. Effective task design targets this zone:
- **Too easy**: Student can complete without thinking → no learning
- **ZPD**: Student needs to think and may need some support → optimal learning
- **Too hard**: Student cannot engage even with support → frustration

## Scaffolding Strategies
### Enabling Prompts (for students who need support)
- Simplify the numbers (smaller, friendlier values)
- Provide a visual model or manipulative
- Break the problem into smaller steps
- Offer a worked example to reference
- Reduce the number of steps required

### Extending Prompts (for students who need challenge)
- "What if the numbers were larger / included decimals?"
- "Can you find all possible solutions?"
- "Can you write a rule that always works?"
- "Explain why this method works using mathematical reasoning"
- "Create a similar problem for a classmate"

## Task Design for Differentiation
### Low Floor, High Ceiling Tasks
Tasks that are accessible to all students but can be extended to challenge advanced learners:
- Open-ended questions with multiple solution paths
- "How many ways can you..." questions
- Investigations that allow varying levels of sophistication

### Parallel Tasks
Two or more tasks that address the same concept but at different levels of complexity. Students choose their entry point:
- Option A: Simpler numbers or fewer steps
- Option B: Grade-level expectation
- Option C: Greater complexity or abstraction

## Flexible Grouping
- Groups should be fluid and change based on the specific skill
- Use diagnostic data to form groups, not fixed "ability" labels
- Include whole-class, small group, pairs, and individual work
- Monitor and adjust groupings regularly based on formative assessment

## Universal Design for Learning (UDL) in Mathematics
- **Multiple means of representation**: Concrete, pictorial, abstract; diagrams, symbols, words
- **Multiple means of engagement**: Choice, relevance, collaboration
- **Multiple means of expression**: Written, verbal, visual, digital
