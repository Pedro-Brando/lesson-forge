# Explicit Instruction in Mathematics

## Overview
Explicit instruction is a structured, systematic approach to teaching that emphasises clear teacher modelling, guided practice, and independent application. It is particularly effective for teaching mathematical procedures, algorithms, and foundational skills.

## The I Do, We Do, You Do Framework

### I Do (Teacher Modelling)
- Teacher demonstrates the complete procedure step by step
- Think-aloud strategy: verbalise decision-making processes
- Use multiple representations (concrete, pictorial, abstract)
- Address anticipated misconceptions proactively
- Connect new learning to prior knowledge

### We Do (Guided Practice)
- Gradual release of responsibility to students
- Teacher provides scaffolded problems with decreasing support
- Use questioning to check for understanding at each step
- Provide immediate corrective feedback
- Monitor student responses through mini-whiteboards or show-me activities

### You Do (Independent Practice)
- Students apply skills independently
- Practice should be purposeful and aligned to the learning intention
- Include varied question types to build fluency and transfer
- Provide self-assessment opportunities against success criteria

## Key Principles for Mathematics
- **Worked examples** reduce cognitive load for novice learners
- **Fading** gradually removes scaffolding as proficiency develops
- **Interleaving** mixes problem types to strengthen discrimination
- **Spaced practice** distributes practice over time for retention
- **Checking for understanding** should occur every 2-3 minutes during instruction

## Research Base
Rosenshine's Principles of Instruction (2012) identify explicit instruction as highly effective for teaching well-structured knowledge and skills. In mathematics, this aligns with the Concrete-Representational-Abstract (CRA) sequence recommended by the Australian curriculum.
