# Assessment Strategies in Mathematics Education

## Formative Assessment
Formative assessment is the ongoing process of gathering evidence about student learning to inform teaching decisions. In mathematics, this includes:

### Diagnostic Assessment
- **Pre-assessment**: Identify entry points and prior knowledge before a unit
- **Misconception probes**: Targeted questions to uncover common errors
- **Number interviews**: One-on-one conversations to understand student thinking
- **Example**: "Show me two ways to partition 47" reveals place value understanding

### Exit Tickets
Exit tickets are rapid end-of-lesson checks (3-5 minutes) that:
- Assess the specific learning intention of that lesson
- Use 2-3 targeted questions at varying cognitive levels
- Inform grouping and differentiation for the next lesson
- Can use traffic light self-assessment (Green = confident, Amber = mostly, Red = need help)

### Success Criteria and Rubrics
Student-facing success criteria should:
- Use "I can..." statements derived from achievement standards
- Be co-constructed with students where possible
- Include examples of quality work at each level
- Enable self-assessment and peer feedback

## Summative Assessment in Mathematics
- Aligned to achievement standards for the year level
- Include questions across all proficiency strands
- Provide opportunities for students to demonstrate understanding in multiple ways
- Use rubrics with clear descriptors for each grade level

## Feedback Principles
Effective mathematical feedback:
1. Is specific to the mathematics (not just "good job")
2. Focuses on the process and strategy, not just the answer
3. Is timely (within the same lesson where possible)
4. Points forward: "Next time, try..."
5. Celebrates mathematical reasoning, even when the answer is incorrect

## Common Misconceptions by Strand
### Number
- "Longer numbers are always bigger" (e.g., 1.25 > 1.3)
- "Multiplication always makes bigger"
- Fraction misconceptions: treating numerator and denominator independently

### Measurement
- Confusing perimeter and area
- Not understanding that different shapes can have the same area

### Statistics
- Confusing mean, median, and mode
- Believing a small sample is always representative
